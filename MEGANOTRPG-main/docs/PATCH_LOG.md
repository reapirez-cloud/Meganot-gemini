# MEGANOTRPG patch log

This file is the canonical release journal for work accumulated on `dev` before promotion to `main`.

## Active patch — 2026-08-31-A

**Status:** OPEN  
**Branch:** `dev`  
**Base main:** `a098751cabf5b8934494ac4725849b3781308a9b`  
**Started:** 2026-08-31

### Player-facing changes

- Added the rebuilt **Wizard / Волшебник** class to the current class catalog, with authored 2024 class text and the new class bootstrap path.
- Added a dedicated Wizard **«Моя книга»** class panel.
- Added the physical **Wizard spellbook** as a real inventory item/runtime dependency rather than a boolean character flag.
- Spellbook contents now belong to a concrete inventory item instance. Losing, transferring, or destroying that book removes access to that instance and its recorded spells.
- A Wizard without a spellbook cannot change daily spell preparation. Previously prepared spells are not erased merely because the book is absent.
- GM/admin can add Wizard spells to a concrete spellbook through **«Выдать закл»**; the player sees only spells actually written in owned spellbooks.
- GENA daily preparation for Wizard is restricted to spells contained in an owned spellbook, with server-side validation rather than UI-only filtering.
- Wizard spell-slot capacity is class/level driven instead of relying on manually authored sheet slot maxima.
- Added a real **Магическое восстановление / Arcane Recovery** interaction. After a GM-granted Short Rest, the assigned player chooses actually expended spell slots to recover; the combined recovered slot levels are limited to `ceil(Wizard level / 2)` and no slot above level 5 is eligible.
- Added an explicit GM **Short Rest** control to the Wizard class surface so Arcane Recovery can be resolved through normal gameplay UI rather than a hidden/admin-only RPC.
- Ordinary Wizard slot casting now requires the spell to be prepared.
- **Знаток ритуалов / Ritual Adept** now exposes a no-slot ritual casting method only for ritual spells that are actually written in a physical spellbook currently held by the character.
- Added **Запоминание заклинания / Memorize Spell** to «Моя книга»: after an authoritative Short Rest the assigned player can replace one eligible prepared Wizard spell with another eligible spell from the held book.
- Added **Мастерство заклинаний / Spell Mastery** selections with the correct level/casting-time filters, always-prepared state, true no-resource lowest-level casts and only one mastered-spell replacement after each Long Rest.
- Added **Фирменные заклинания / Signature Spells** selections: two level-3 book-backed spells remain always prepared and each has its own free cast that recharges after a Short or Long Rest.
- GENA no longer counts Spell Mastery or Signature Spells against the ordinary prepared-spell quota.
- GENA now surfaces the Wizard cantrip replacement right as an informational post-rest notice. Cantrip changes, Scholar Expertise, ASI and Epic Boon sheet decisions deliberately use the normal player → GM sheet-edit path instead of class-specific mini-engines.
- Prepared the Wizard subclass foundation without exposing empty/incomplete subclass cards to players; individual subclasses become visible only when their actual package is implemented.
- Added interactive **MEGANOTRPG Engine Studio UI**:
  - Live **Character Sheet** driven directly by `resolveCharacterContract()` (CE v1) with reactive HP adjustments and Short/Long Rest determinism.
  - Authoritative **TOBIK Dice Roller** supporting cryptographic randomness, advantage/disadvantage, dropped-dice tracking, and Nat 20/Nat 1 detection.
  - Dynamic **Actions & Mechanics** catalog resolving granted actions, resource expenditure checks, and execution logs.
  - Interactive **Reynar Voss Narrative Voice** reference and author attitude viewer (`vossVoice.ts`, `spellReferenceAuthor.ts`).
  - Searchable **Spell Catalog** powered by Chasovoy definitions with school filtering and Voss commentary.
  - Interactive **8-Engine Named Architecture Explorer** documenting ownership boundaries (CE, GENA, ORACLE, TOBIK, CHEBURASHKA, SHAPOKLYAK, LARISA, CHASOVOY).

### Runtime and rules changes

- Hardened GENA post-rest preparation authority and one-shot locking for assigned players.
- Extended character-preparation metadata with stable class catalog identity so class-specific availability rules do not depend on localized display names.
- Extended inventory persistence with stable Chasovoy definition identity (`definition_id` + revision) for concrete item instances.
- Added Wizard spellbook runtime storage/RPCs and spellbook-aware preparation validation.
- Added authoritative Wizard spellbook progression: six level-1 spells at Wizard level 1 and two additional eligible Wizard spells for every later Wizard level.
- Added a reusable full-caster spell-slot mechanic that emits canonical `spell_slot_N` CE resources and leaves mutable current values in the shared character resource ledger.
- Added Wizard core mechanical grants for Intelligence/Wisdom saving throws, simple weapons, class skill selection and the one-use-per-Long-Rest Arcane Recovery resource.
- Added the missing authoritative Short Rest server seam: `grant_character_short_rest` performs normal `short_rest` resource recovery and opens a short-rest resolution window; ordinary assigned-player speech closes that window and Long Rest closes any stale one.
- Added a generic spell-slot restoration primitive that validates weighted recovery budgets, maximum slot level and actually expended slots against `character_resource_states` before mutating canonical slot state.
- Arcane Recovery uses a narrow Wizard server wrapper that verifies the active Wizard assignment, the Short Rest window, Wizard level and the real once-per-Long-Rest resource before restoring slots.
- Added durable Memorize Spell, Spell Mastery and Signature Spells state with server-side eligibility validation against the held physical spellbook.
- Spell Mastery uses a genuinely resource-free CE casting method; Signature Spells use separate CE resources with `short_rest` + `long_rest` recovery.
- CE runtime now projects held Wizard spellbook membership through read-only persistence queries rather than routing a source-loader read through a class-specific RPC.
- Manual Wizard choices that do not need deterministic bookkeeping are recorded as `gena_notice_then_gm_sheet_edit` / normal GM sheet edits rather than receiving bespoke choice state.
- Continued generic template-choice runtime cleanup and class-work ledger updates required by the current class rebuild.
- Added Wizard subclass **Wave 0** structural contract: exactly 13 supported stable catalog identities, a common `class:wizard` parent, subclass unlock at Wizard level 3, and the normalized 3/6/10/14 feature schedule used by the 2024 base class.
- Reserved stable visual identities for all 13 Wizard subclasses and added a structural package validator that rejects the wrong parent, an early unlock, unsupported catalog identities, or feature rows outside 3/6/10/14.
- PHB 2024 Evoker, Diviner, Illusionist and Abjurer are the canonical identities for those four schools; duplicate 2014 variants are not introduced. Older supported schools/supplements retain their rule package but enter through the Wizard 2024 compatibility schedule.
- Wave 0 deliberately reuses the generic rule-template resolver for parent-class effective level and CE emission; it does not introduce a Wizard-specific subclass engine, turn tracker, scene state or bespoke choice runtime.
- Refined Character Engine TypeScript type-narrowing in `actions.ts`, `grants.ts`, `resources.ts`, and `spells.ts` for strict TypeScript check compliance.

### Repository / release process

- Added this persistent patch journal as the canonical ledger for everything accumulated on `dev` before release.
- Root `AGENTS.md` now requires every coding agent to update the Active patch as part of task completion.
- An explicit user command to promote to `main` now formally closes the current patch; after successful promotion, `dev` must open a new empty Active patch based on the new `main` SHA.
- Released patch history is immutable: later fixes belong to the next patch instead of being backdated into an already shipped release.

### Tests / verification added in this patch

- Added GENA preparation authority regression coverage.
- Added Wizard text-ready coverage.
- Added dedicated Wizard spellbook runtime regression coverage for physical item identity, GM spell authoring, book-gated GENA preparation and the «Моя книга» UI path.
- Added dedicated Wizard spellbook progression regression coverage for six starting spells, +2 per Wizard level and held-book grant validation.
- Added dedicated Wizard Arcane Recovery regression coverage for CE resource resolution, parser-owned full-caster slots, authoritative Short Rest, weighted slot restoration and Oracle/UI wiring.
- Added `wizardCompletionRuntime` coverage for prepared ordinary casts, held-book rituals, Memorize Spell, Spell Mastery, Signature Spells, GENA/manual-choice boundaries and shared strict class quality/resource/parser/CE gates.
- Added resource-policy metadata to every Wizard completion mechanics migration so the repository-wide class resource-policy gate audits the whole slice.
- Updated official class catalog coverage for the rebuilt Wizard catalog entry.
- Added `patchJournalContract` regression coverage so the repository cannot silently lose the patch-journal lifecycle contract.
- Added `wizardSubclassWave0` regression coverage for all 13 stable identities, PHB 2024 replacement policy, Wizard parent linkage, level-3 unlock, 3/6/10/14 feature rows and parent-Wizard-level multiclass gating.
- Wizard dev runtime closure reached a fully green CI on run **#1152** before the subclass Wave 0 work; Wave 0 receives its own current-head CI check before completion is claimed.

### Known incomplete work

- The **Wizard 2024 base-class runtime has no known implementation blocker on `dev`** in the current subclass-free scope.
- Overall Wizard mechanics remain **IN_PROGRESS** because the intended deployed Supabase state has not yet been applied/certified and actual subclass content is still being built; Git-only closure is not production certification.
- Found-spell/scroll transcription, Scholar Expertise, cantrip replacement, ASI and Epic Boon use the agreed GM-adjudicated/normal-sheet path by design and are not missing Wizard-specific automation.
- Wizard subclass **Wave 0 infrastructure is complete on `dev`**, but no empty placeholder subclass is installed. Wave 1 begins the real subclass packages, starting with Evoker.

## Journal rules

The executable agent rule lives in `/AGENTS.md`. In short: work on `dev` belongs to the Active patch; an explicit user command to promote to `main` closes that patch; after successful promotion, `dev` immediately opens the next empty Active patch based on the new `main` SHA.
